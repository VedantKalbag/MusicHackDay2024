# Inspira
Inspira is a tool for songwriters that helps get past their writer's block. It listens to their track and suggests similar chart topping numbers and generated music. Hopefully this INSPIRES them!


## How to use
1. Upload your roughly **produced** track on to GUI
2. UI populates 5 similar audio streams (2 generated & 3 released music)
3. Get inspired!

## What's under the hood

Input  - Audio file (.mp3) <br>
Output - A list of UI embedded audio streams <br>
